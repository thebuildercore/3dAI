# 3dAI
# 🧑‍💻 3dAI 

## 📖 Overview  
The **3dAI** is an interactive, AI-powered system that blends **Next.js** frontend with **Unity-powered 3D avatars**. Unlike plain chatbots, this project creates a **streaming-style experience** where users can interact with lifelike characters in real time.  

Each avatar is more than a skin — it has a **unique personality, voice, and expression system**, making conversations engaging, fun, and emotionally intelligent. The long-term vision is to evolve this into a **multi-avatar streaming platform**, where users can switch between or interact with multiple characters.

## 🔍 Insights  
- Traditional chatbots feel **flat and impersonal**.  
- Visual interaction (avatars, gestures, voices) drives **higher engagement**.  
- Unity integration inside a **dedicated "avatar room"** ensures high-quality rendering without bloating the whole app.  
- By using **prefabs + JSON/ScriptableObjects**, avatars can be easily added, updated, or swapped.  
- A streaming-first design allows this project to scale into **interactive entertainment, education, or productivity platforms**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. **Create lifelike conversations** with AI + 3D avatars.  
2. **Support multiple avatars/characters** with swappable personalities.  
3. **Build a modular frontend**: Next.js app handles chat, UI, and routing, while Unity powers immersive avatar rooms.  
4. **Enable real-time streaming** so avatars can act as companions, hosts, or performers.  
5. **Design for scalability**: multi-avatar support, personality presets, and future multiplayer/group chat.  
6. **Lay groundwork for future roadmap**: AR/VR integration, avatar marketplace, community streaming.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS)  
- **3D Engine**: Unity (avatar rendering, animations, lip sync, expressions)  
- **Backend**: AI/LLM integration (chat + voice)  
- **Streaming**: WebRTC / LiveKit (planned for multi-avatar streaming)  
- **Data Layer**: JSON / ScriptableObjects (avatar configs, personalities)  

---

## 🖥️ How It Works  
1. Users land on the **Next.js frontend**.  
2. They select or enter a **chat room**.  
3. Inside the room, a **Unity WebGL/streaming build** renders the chosen avatar.  
4. The avatar is controlled via AI backend → lip sync, gestures, and chat responses.  
5. Multiple avatars can be added for **streaming, co-hosting, or group chats**.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap  
- ✅ Multi-avatar selection system  
- ✅ Data-driven personalities (config files)  
- 🔲 Voice streaming with AI-generated voices  
- 🔲 Multi-user rooms with multiple avatars  
- 🔲 AR/VR immersive integration  
- 🔲 Avatar marketplace for custom drops
